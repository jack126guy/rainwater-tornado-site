After being in "unscheduled maintenance" for the previous several weeks, the [Pony Music Archive](https://ponemusic.net/) officially announced its end earlier this month.

Rainwater Tornado has saved all of the [torrents]({{< relref "/collections/pony-music-archive/index.md" >}}) for the Pony Music Archive. However, because of space limitations, it is only seeding the High Quality and Phone Quality torrents of the latest version.

The Raw Quality files are currently stored offline as a last-resort option if there are no seeds for the torrent. If you have the ability to seed that torrent, please e-mail <jackgraysonfox@gmail.com> to make arrangements.

Many thanks to H.T. Nyquist and all the other archivists in the fandom.
