Rainwater Tornado preserves archives and collections of My Little Pony fan music. However, unlike other projects, Rainwater Tornado's goal isn't to create one giant super-archive; rather, it's to preserve existing collections as they are.

The main job of this project is to seed collections of music through BitTorrent. People don't always have their computers running 24 / 7 to seed their torrents, so Rainwater Tornado acts as a backup.

## A Little Background on BitTorrent

BitTorrent works by downloading data from multiple other computers on the Internet that have the same file (called a "torrent"); these other computers are said to be "seeding" the file. This system makes the file more accessible because the download isn't tied to a single location (like a file-hosting website), which could become unavailable.

To download a file from BitTorrent, you need a program called a BitTorrent client. There are many available; one popular option is [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/).

## Donate

Running this server isn't cheap, and the cost grows when more and more torrents are seeded. Please consider [buying "coffee" on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jackgraysonfox). If you include Rainwater Tornado in your note I will reserve the proceeds specifically for the costs associated with this server.

## Thanks

Rainwater Tornado wouldn't be possible without the work of [many great people]({{< relref "/about/thanks.md" >}}).
