## New Collections

New collections are always welcome. These include:

* Other archives
* Community albums
* Artist collections

Of particular interest are any collections that are less well-known or at risk of being lost.

Existing torrents are good, but they can be direct downloads as well.

To suggest a new collection, please e-mail <jackgraysonfox@gmail.com>. Be sure to include a link to a torrent or download source.

## Donations

Running this isn't cheap, and the cost grows when more collections are added. If you can, please consider [buying some "coffee" on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jackgraysonfox) to help offset the costs. (If you include Rainwater Tornado in your note I will reserve the proceeds specifically for the costs associated with this project.)

## Technical Assistance

* You can seed these torrents on your own computer (especially the ones that Rainwater Tornado isn't actually seeding) for added resilience. (Check the [updates section]({{< relref "/updates" >}}) for all new torrents.)
* If you have any ideas for how to improve the server infrastructure, please share them via e-mail at <jackgraysonfox@gmail.com>. (Currently it's just a basic DigitalOcean droplet with a block volume.)
* If you have any ideas for how to improve the website, open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/jack126guy/rainwater-tornado-site).
